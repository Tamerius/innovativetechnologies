# Smart running clothing

This is a pressure cooker theme project by Rogier Mutter and Yannick Tamerius, which means that we're spending just two weeks to create something epic.

The idea we have is to make running clothing smart, and let it light up automatically when it starts glimmering outside. This is not only awesome looking, as it also improves safety.
